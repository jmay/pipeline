All scripts that expect "normalized TSV" have the following expectations for input:

* no blank lines
* tab-separated fields
* all fields have been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
* fields have no internal whitespace except for single spaces(" ") - no newlines, no tabs
* fields are not quoted, any quotation marks are assumed to be part of the value
* text is in UTF-8
* any chronology values have been converted to sequential integer indexes

Output is guaranteed to have the same characteristics as the input.
